Release `@virtuoso.dev/data-table` 0.1.0 as the first stable version. The package provides row and column virtualization, grouped rows, sticky columns, remote loading, column resize/reorder/visibility, dynamic columns, and state persistence.

Bump `@virtuoso.dev/reactive-engine-core` and `@virtuoso.dev/reactive-engine-react` for SSR support required by the data table: synchronous engine creation in `EngineProvider` and an `isDisposed` flag on `Engine`.
