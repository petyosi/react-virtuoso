## FAQ

### How many licenses do I need?

The number of licenses to the maximum number of concurrent front-end developers who contribute to a project that uses the package.
This also includes developers who work on the project part-time or as contractors. See more details in the [message list licensing section](/virtuoso-message-list/licensing).

### What happens when I make a purchase?

You will receive a license key on the email you provide. You put the license key in the `licenseKey` prop of the `VirtuosoMessageListLicense` component and you are good to go.

### What happens after my license expires?

The purchased license works indefinitely in production. If you want to continue active development using the component, you should update your subscription.

### Can I try before I make a purchase decision?

Yes, you can use the package in development mode without a license for 30 days.

### What is the guaranteed response time of the pro plan?

Within 2 business days, you are going to get a reply back from the authors of the package.
