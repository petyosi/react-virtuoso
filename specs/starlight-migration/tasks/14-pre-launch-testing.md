# Pre-launch testing

Comprehensive testing checklist before switching domains. Test all interactive features (search, code examples, payment flow). Verify all external links work. Check cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Test on mobile devices. Run through common user journeys. Have team members review and provide feedback. Create rollback plan in case issues are discovered post-launch.
