# Content migration and verification

Systematically verify that all content from the old Docusaurus site has been migrated to the new Starlight site. Create a checklist of all pages, guides, and examples from the old site. The old site has legal pages (Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Message List EULA) that need to be migrated. Check for any missing images, code examples, or supplementary files. Ensure all internal links have been updated to the new URL structure.
