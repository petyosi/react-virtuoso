# Reorganize examples and guides

Review existing examples in packages/react-virtuoso/examples/ and documentation. Update or remove examples using unmaintained dependencies (check if current packages still work). Identify gaps in coverage - areas where users commonly need guidance but docs are thin. Create new focused examples for advanced use cases like window scrolling, grouped lists, or third-party integrations. Ensure all examples work with current package versions.

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit existing examples
