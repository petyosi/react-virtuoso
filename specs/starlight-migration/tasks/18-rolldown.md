# Rolldown exploration

Evaluate replacing Vite with Rolldown for package builds. Rolldown is a Rust-based bundler (Rollup successor) that promises faster build times. Benchmark build performance against current Vite setup. Ensure all existing build features work (TypeScript, JSX, tree-shaking). Only switch if there are meaningful performance gains without regressions.

## Tasks

- [ ] Benchmark Rolldown vs Vite
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing build config
- [ ] Evaluate performance trade-offs
