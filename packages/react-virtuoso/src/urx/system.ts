/**
 * ## Thinking in Systems
 * systems are a stateful **data-processing machines** which accept input through **input streams**,
 * init and maintain state in **depots** and, in certain conditions, emit values to subscriptions through **output streams**.
 * Systems can specify other systems as dependencies, and can act as singletons in the resulting dependency tree.
 *
 * ### Depots
 *
 * The first, and probably the most critical part to understand are **the depots**
 * mostly because they are somewhat implicit.
 * Unlike other state management paradigms, the depots are not kept in a single data structure.
 * Insted, depots are defined and maintained as stateful streams, stateful transfomers
 * like [[combineLatest]] or stateful operators like[ []withLatestFrom] or [[scan]].
 *
 * **Depots persist values over time**.
 * If it was not for them, the system had to re-receive its entire input state simultaneously in order to calculate the values for its output stream.
 *
 * Of course, strictly speaking, it is possible to implement a pure, stateless system as a form of a complex map/reduce. urx would not mind that ;).
 *
 * ### Input Streams
 *
 * The system receives updates from the rest of the world through values published in its input streams.
 * The streams used can be either stateless (acting as means to send **signals**) or stateful, where the initial stream state acts as the default value for that system parameter.
 *
 * The effects of the input streams are up to the system data-processing logic. It can change its depots' state, and/or emit values through its output streams.
 *
 * ### Data Processing
 *
 * The actual system behavior is exclusively implemented by **applying transformers and operators** to the input streams, producing the respective output streams.
 * In the final state the system streams are organized in a directed graph, where incoming data is routed through certain edges and nodes.
 * Simple systems like the one in [urx by example](https://urx.virtuoso.dev/docs/urx-by-example) can use a straightforward single-step transformation (in this case, `combineLatest` and `map`),
 * while complex ones can introduce multiple intermediate streams to model their logic.
 *
 * ### Output Streams
 *
 * The system publishes updates to its clients (other systems or an UI bound to it) by publishing data in its output streams.
 * State-reflecting output streams, like `sum` in the [urx by example](https://urx.virtuoso.dev/docs/urx-by-example) should use stateful streams as output streams.
 * Signal-like output should use regular, stateless streams. In general, stateless input streams tend to have a symmetrical stateless streams, and the opposite.

/**
 * `system` defines a specification of a system - its constructor, dependencies and if it should act as a singleton in a system dependency tree.
 * When called, system returns a [[SystemSpec]], which is then initialized along with its dependencies by passing it to [[init]].
 *
 * ```ts
 * @import { subscribe, publish, system, init, tup, connect, map, pipe } from 'urx'
 *
 * // a simple system with two streams
 * const sys1 = system(() => {
 *  const a = stream<number>()
 *  const b = stream<number>()
 *
 *  connect(pipe(a, map(value => value * 2)), b)
 *  return { a, b }
 * })
 *
 * // a second system which depends on the streams from the first one
 * const sys2 = system(([ {a, b} ]) => {
 *  const c = stream<number>()
 *  connect(pipe(b, map(value => value * 2)), c)
 *  // re-export the `a` stream, keep `b` internal

 * ```
 *
 * #### Singletons in Dependency Tree
 *
 * By default, systems will be initialized only once if encountered multiple times in the dependency tree.
 * In the below dependency system tree, systems `b` and `c` will receive the same stream instances from system `a` when system `d` is initialized.
 * ```txt
 *   a
 *  / \
 * b   c
 *  \ /
 *   d
 * ```
 * If `a` gets `{singleton: false}` as a last argument, `init` creates two separate instances - one for `b` and one for `c`.
 *
 * @param constructor the system constructor function. Initialize and connect the streams in its body.
 *
 * @param dependencies the system dependencies, which the constructor will receive as arguments.
 * Use the [[tup]] utility **For TypeScript type inference to work correctly**.
 * ```ts
 * const sys3 = system(() => { ... }, tup(sys2, sys1))
 * ```
 * @param __namedParameters Options
 * @param singleton determines if the system will act as a singleton in a system dependency tree. `true` by default.
