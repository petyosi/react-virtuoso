React Virtuoso tries to hide as much complexity as possible while maintaining sensible behavior with any configuration.
The magic has certain limits, so please check this section if something does not work as you expect.

## List is jumping around or misbehaving

The list relies on measuring the item sizes and dynamically updating its position based on the received data.
This is more of an art than science in some use cases, especially when it comes to reverse scrolling.
Certain content factors like dynamic content (images, iframes, etc.) can cause trouble.

To get a better sense of whether this is your case, you can enable debug logging either by setting the `logLevel` property to `LogLevel.DEBUG` or by setting a `globalThis.VIRTUOSO_LOG_LEVEL` to `LogLevel.DEBUG`.
Import `LogLevel` from the `react-virtuoso` package.
Afterward, set the logging level in your browser to `"all levels"` and observe the messages for unexpected item sizes reported outside of the normal render cycle.

## List does not scroll to the bottom / items jump around

This is the most common setup error. It happens because the DOM elements inside the items (or the items themselves) have margins.

### Why margins break Virtuoso

Virtuoso measures item sizes using `ResizeObserver`, which reports the `contentRect` of each element. The `contentRect` **does not include margins**. When items have margins, Virtuoso calculates a smaller total height than the actual rendered content, preventing users from scrolling to the end of the list.

### How to diagnose

1. Open your browser's developer tools
2. Select a list item element
3. Go to the **Computed** tab (next to Styles)
4. Look for non-zero `margin-top` or `margin-bottom` values

### Common culprits

These HTML elements have default margins that often cause issues:

- `<p>` - paragraphs have top and bottom margins
- `<h1>` through `<h6>` - headings have significant margins
- `<ul>`, `<ol>` - lists have top and bottom margins
- `<blockquote>` - block quotes have margins
- `<pre>` - preformatted text has margins

### Fix

Replace margins with padding. For elements with default margins, explicitly set `margin: 0` and use padding instead:

```jsx
// Before (broken)
<Virtuoso
  totalCount={100}
  itemContent={(index) => <p>Item {index}</p>}
/>

// After (fixed)
<Virtuoso
  totalCount={100}
  itemContent={(index) => <p style={{ margin: 0, padding: '8px 0' }}>Item {index}</p>}
/>
```

## I get "Error: zero-sized element, this should not happen"

Technically, this could have been a warning, but it is usually a sign of something not working as expected, so throwing an error is better for you.
This means that you either have empty items (something which Virtuoso can't support), or you are hitting a bug of some sort
(could be due to some exotic integration scenario).

### Fix

If you have zero-height items, you need to filter those out before passing them to the component.
The internal data structure needs a distinct position for each item. There's no way to fix this.

## Components remount on every scroll

If your list items remount (lose state, re-run effects) every time you scroll, you're likely defining components inline.

### Why this happens

When you define a component function inside your render function, React creates a new component type on every render. Even if the JSX looks identical, React treats it as a different component and unmounts/remounts it.

```jsx
// Bad: Component defined inline - remounts on every render
function App() {
  const ItemComponent = ({ index }) => <div>Item {index}</div>
  return <Virtuoso totalCount={100} itemContent={(index) => <ItemComponent index={index} />} />
}
```

### Fix

Define components outside the render function, or use `React.memo` for complex item content:

```jsx
// Good: Component defined outside
const ItemComponent = ({ index }) => <div>Item {index}</div>

function App() {
  return <Virtuoso totalCount={100} itemContent={(index) => <ItemComponent index={index} />} />
}
```

```jsx
// Also good: Using React.memo for expensive components
const ExpensiveItem = React.memo(({ index, data }) => {
  // Complex rendering logic here
  return <div>Item {index}: {data}</div>
})

const itemContent = (index) => <ExpensiveItem index={index} data={items[index]} />

function App() {
  return <Virtuoso totalCount={100} itemContent={itemContent} />
}
```

See the [custom rendering documentation](/customize-rendering) for more details on component customization patterns.

## Webpack dev server shows an error `Uncaught Error: ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications`

This is a known issue with the Webpack dev server and the `ResizeObserver` API used by Virtuoso. To silence this error, apply the following configuration to your server:

```javascript
  devServer: {
    client: {
      overlay: {
        errors: true,
        warnings: false,
        runtimeErrors: false, // this eliminates the error.
      },
    },
  },
```

## Sentry catches an error `ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded` or `ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications`
