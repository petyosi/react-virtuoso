## Hooks

You can access the message list's internal state and methods by calling hooks inside the inner components. The message list component exposes the following hooks:

- `useVirtuosoMethods` - the equivalent of the `ref` prop, which gives you access to the message list methods.
- `useVirtuosoLocation` - gives you access to the current `ListScrollLocation`.
- `useCurrentlyRenderedData` - gives you access to the currently rendered data items. Useful if you want to display information for the first or last rendered item.

:::info
The `useVirtuosoMethods` hook exposes several data operations. To make it type-safe, you should pass the type of data and the context you're using in the message list as a type parameters.

```tsx
// For a message list with items of type { message: string } and context of type { user: string }
const methods = useVirtuosoMethods<{ message: string }, { user: string }>()
```

:::

Both hooks are used in the tutorial to implement [the scroll to bottom button](/virtuoso-message-list/tutorial/scroll-to-bottom-button).
